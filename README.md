# Competitive Programming Libraries

A collection of **code templates** and **algorithms** for competitive programming contests.

## Features
- **Efficient Implementations**: Well-optimized code for common algorithms and data structures.
- **Easy to Use**: Ready-to-use templates for quick integration into solutions.
- **Categorized**: Organized by topics (e.g., graphs, math, strings).

## Topics Covered
- Data Structures (e.g., Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees)
- Graph Algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, DFS, BFS)
- Math (e.g., Number Theory, Combinatorics)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired topic folder.
3. Copy and paste the template into your solution.
